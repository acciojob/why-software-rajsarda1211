	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving complex problems through technology and building applications that can have a real-world impact. I love the process of creating something from scratch, continuously learning, and seeing how my work can improve efficiency, user experience, or provide innovative solutions. Development allows me to combine creativity with logical thinking, and I’m excited about contributing to a field that’s constantly evolving.</p>
